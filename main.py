#! This is the main script in the python logging introduction framework.

#! We aim to create a logging thread and add it to our flight program framework. The goal is to
#  place the current vehicle state into a logging queue that is then read by the logging thread
#  and logged in a seperate process on the CPU.

#  Note since we append control_thread to the threads list, they are both looking
#  at the same memory location. Thus, what we do to contorl_thread we are in effect
#  doing to threads['control_thread'], and vice versa.
