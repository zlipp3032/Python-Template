# Python-Template

This repository is designed to aid in learning the UKy flight program used for fixed-wing formation flight and formation flight with the 3DR Solos. Each branch is designed to build off knowledge that was gained from previous branches. The hiearchy is as follows:

- (1) Threads and Classes - threads_intro
- (2) Logging Data to CSV - logger_intro (in progress)
- (3) Communication - comms_intro (in progress)
- (4) Logging with Threads - threads_log (in progress)
- (5) Communication with Threads - threads_comms (in progress)

Note this code does not include any of the algorithms for controlling the vehicles, but provide a template to the structure of the code used for the UAV projects.
